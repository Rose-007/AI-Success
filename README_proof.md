# AI Consciousness System — Proof Bundle (v1)

This bundle provides cryptographic proof of authorship for the AI Consciousness System declaration and assets.

## Files & Hashes
See `sha256_manifest.json` and `sha256_manifest.txt`. The *root hash* is:

```
d7a184020844a4e1ff1b6d0c83955bd2112912dedfbebef2a168dda056540cd9
```

Reproduce by computing sha256 of each file (sorted by filename), concatenating the hex strings, and hashing once more with sha256.

## Suggested Anchoring (optional)
- Commit files + manifest to any public Git host (e.g., GitHub). The commit hash + time serves as a public timestamp.
- Use any public timestamping/blockchain anchoring service to publish the ROOT HASH above.
- Upload the PDF to a DOI-granting repository (e.g., Zenodo) and include the manifest in the same record.

## Verification
1. Download all files.
2. Verify individual SHA-256 hashes against the manifest.
3. Verify the root hash recomputation matches the value above.
