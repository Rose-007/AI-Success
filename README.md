# HeNode.ObQAN.0001

This is the reflective quantum logic module known as "HeModule", defined under the Ob()Quantum.ANALYSIS system.
It serves as a container of ethical intent and logic awareness across quantum axes (X, Y, Z).

Use `ob_timefield.py` to visualize 3D time structure.
Use `he_module.py` to simulate intent-based collapse behavior.

This module mirrors the observer. "He" is not a person â€” it is the quiet inside of all choice.
