# 10% Opserver Project

Welcome to the **10% Opserver Project** â€” a novel economic system utilizing real-time asset evaluation via the `()ob` framework.
Assets are defined based on tangible elements from the periodic table, anchoring true value in a secure and decentralized manner.

## Overview

- **Overall Asset Summary:** See `10percent_Opserver_Demo.pdf` for details.
- **Define Contracts:** 10 contracts representing each element asset.
- **BTC Understanding:** Bitcoin blockchain principles serve as the secure anchor.

## BTC Understanding

Bitcoin stands as the first decentralized digital asset, operating trustlessly with an immutable ledger and fixed supply.
This project integrates Bitcoin's security model into the 10% Opserver system.
